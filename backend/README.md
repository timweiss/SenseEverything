# Backend
Backend for the Social Interaction Sensing project.
Open the [api.yaml](api.yaml) for the API specification. This will likely change as the backend gets built.

## Setup
We use Node.js v20.13.1. If you use nvm, you can run `nvm use` to switch to the correct version.

To install all dependencies, run:
```shell
npm i
```
